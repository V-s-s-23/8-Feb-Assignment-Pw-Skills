    "# Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "### Answer:- Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a mechanism of hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object to the outside world. It means that an object's internal implementation is hidden, and only the object's external behavior is visible to the user. The goal of abstraction is to simplify complex systems by reducing the amount of information that needs to be dealt with."
